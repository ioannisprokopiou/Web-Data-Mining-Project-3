Nicktrip,"May 12, 2018",May 2018,Kanoula,GREAT food in a small indiffernet place,"There is no way to find this small restaurant by chance as it is located in a short, narrow street far away from the city center. But there is good reason to search for it. And the reason is the very best food it offers. It has only eight tables in a small room, indifferently decorated. The quality of food is excellent. We tried a huge salad with fresh and roasted vegetables on a bed of crunchy toasted bread, full of the aroma of fresh basil. Risotto with asparagus was also a huge tasty plate with lots of fresh asparagus, although the rice was a bit overboiled. Finally the all time classic giaourtlou kebab we both chose was excellent. The price was very cheap, we paid less than forty euros for four plates and two beers (plus an extra superb orange pie, free of charge). That's why this small gem is on the top list of TA.

FloopySandlet101,"October 8, 2016",October 2016,Tripia Potiria,"Foodgasm, period.","Well, what a surprise... We went to Tripia Potiria (bit bazzar) for the first time to just eat bits & bytes, since neither of us was really hungry, plus one of us had some stomach pain.

What we got then was just incredible.

Even though the resaurant is number 1 (at the time of this review) on TripAdvisor, we approached it skeptically, especially after seeing that it is one of the empties places in the whole bit bazzar area which was overflooded by youngsters enjoying their Saturday night.

Well, the reason for the emptiness quickly became apparent to us. Basically all of the places that were full had youngsters enjoying their time (primarily drinking), whilst Tripia Potiria is really a place for people who would like to enjoy their food experience. (Needless to say, Tripia Potiria filled up as well within 30 minutes of our arrival, so maybe we went there early?)

Anyway, back on topic: Tripia Potiria was just an incredible experience both because of the very-very good prices and yet wonderful quality and even better portion sizes. All the different meals that we tried were just fantastic in taste, which correlates to what one of the waiters’ told us: that basically they non-stop experiment with what to keep on the menu and what to add as new dishes. With this one of us was able to eat a seemingly basic mustard chicken dish, which was so tasty that the taste is still in the mouth... yummy!

After the first occasion, we even went back for round #2 (this time hungry), where we were able to taste even more fantastic dishes, all prepared with a great desire to please the stomach. Nearly all of them resulted in minor foodgasms for both of us, which was such a welcome feeling after having hiked the whole day.

To top it all off, we had the chance to meet the owner, Agilos, who was a very friendly chap with whom we shared a nice raki as according to Cretan tradition (as he worked there for 17 years and we travelled from Crete to Thessaloniki).

But in Tarantino, it's not just the food that will bring you back. It is the friendly smiling faces in a cosy place with the best hip hop tunes. It is the aesthetics and every little detail taken care of from the owners.

Definitely an extra is its spot. Located on the street with one of the most interesting histories in town, next to the hippest neighborhood, Tarantino is perfect for a late night bite combining the old with the new.

Well, the super friendly staff of Faidimos at the centre of Thessaloniki didn't mind and, in fact, made me feel very comfortable and eventually more than satisfied.
All (but two or three) dishes off the rich menu are or can be made gluten-free (i.e. celiac-friendly), and the chef was very willing to customise the dishes tailored to anyone's needs.

As for the taste and quality, I don't find food that delicious quite often.

nikogreeko89,"February 26, 2019",February 2019,Vary Peponi (Heavy Melon),Amazing tastes - Cosy environment,"This lovely small restaurant has been hiding in a small alley in the centre of the city.
I have heard a lot about it and after a green suggested it to me, I paid a visit curious about the food and its atmosphere.

Even small at first, it is very nice and cosy with exemplary simple yet lovely decor. Brings a flair of older times married with present in a way I liked a lot! You can see this on the pictures on the wall and in the winning area where modern marble tables are combined with old-school chairs.

The service was really nice, suggesting us a few good dishes to try which are on the ""temporary"" menu. She was also very helpful and smiley suggesting us to cut down on ordering too many which was a surprise for me and she was actually right. We appreciated that a lot!

We ordered a seasonal green salad, aubergine rolls, hünkâr beğendi and meatballs yiaourtlou.

The salad was nice topped with a few olives and virgin olive oil. Greens were nicely boiled and as crunchy as they should be.
The rolls were accompanied by a sundried tomato pesto and a cheese from Chios island. This was the most spectacular dish of all with an amazing combination of flavours I've never tried before! The only drawback was that it was a bit too salty which was a shame given the flavours and ingredients. A small setback here...
That was my first time trying hünkâr and I have to say this was marvellous! Absolutely delicious with aubergine pure alongside very nicely presented together. Tasted like proper homemade food with amazing aromas and species. Loved it! A must try dish!
Finally, the meatballs arrived alongside a few pita bread pieces, the yiaourtlou sauce and tomato sauce with herbs on top of the meatballs. Reminded my grandma's meatballs which made it a bit more specially to me. Very nice flavour here as well, nice combination of species and herbs and the yiaourtlou sauce was a refreshing touch next to it. Nicely done!

A very nice dinning experience in a cosy place with friendly staff. I would only prefer a bit better music and less salty dishes but the food is absolutely fantastic and the prices are very reasonable!! Must try!!",4.0

DimitrisD976,"February 3, 2016",January 2016,Roots Vegan & Vegetarian Place,A vegetarian restaurant in the heart of Thessaloniki,"Some time ago a large English-speaking newspaper published an article on culinary Thessaloniki and pointed out some restaurants worth visiting.roots was among them. I didn't have the chance to visit the restaurant before this article, so I took some time to go for a quick snack and see if the fuss is worth it. Placed in the heart of the city's market the relatively small Roots offers a menu with vegetarian dishes, like hummus, falafel, and various salads. The staff is really friendly, but after having left the place, there is nothing else to remember about the visit. The dishes are OK, but somehow overpriced for what you get. A falafel for 8 Euros is certainly not the price you are willing to pay for relatively small portions again. Even though someone understands the effort restaurant people are making to keep their business alive in the midst of the financial crisis in Greece, someone would expect from a restaurant, even from a small one which can be confused with a cafe serving some dishes, to keep their toilets in a good condition. Not that they were dirty, but they were somehow neglected in terms of appearance. Thessaloniki has by far more interesting places to go and have interesting dishes.

Granted this is everywhere the case in Greece and yes there is a ventilation system inside but still: where the smoking ban is respected in almost every European country, Greece just does not seem to care.

Well that's where the great ends I am afraid. Arriving and seeing that there were not busy at all, on a night where everywhere else was alive and buzzing should have been a warning. The service was not bad just the quality of the food or should I say the food that was presented in a can. Yes, for entree I decided to have anchovies. After visiting Italy and enjoying the fresh local anchovies there I thought I would try them here. How wrong was I! Out came a small plate with a small can of anchovies and a teeny Werner salad. The can was open and only had about 2 tiny anchovies inside. This looked like they had taken the rest to use later maybe? Nothing like what I was expecting....REALLY! I am not going to ramble on as i think this says it all. Do yourself and your wallet a favour and steer clear of this place.

Maybe it just self-respect the restaurant owners don’t have.
This place is perfect. Top quality and Top service. Quality is surely based on the chef and service is based on the well spoken and mannered staff.

The place itself is nice, especially the uniquely decorated restrooms and the terrace.
Excellent service, nice and friendly staff.
Lot of complimentary small things, Greek liquers, jelly candies...
Freshly baked bread served with different domestic dips, as starter, was really delicious.
For main dish we had grilled Octopus in very interesting dip, served with rock samphire - excellent idea - (8/10), grilled shrimps (7/10), seafood salad (7/10) and terrible grilled squids (0/10)!!! It was stated in the menu ""frozen"", however nobody expected something like that - tasteless, cut into pieces (???)...
There were a lot of excuses for those squids, like ""we are changing the supplier..."" but the point is that such meal MUST NOT come to the table in the restaurant like Frutti di Mare, as from all the other aspects they should strive for much higher standard.

Pros:

My wife informs me (the gluten free guy!!) that the bread is absolutely amazing!

I recommend the Techni Alipias white wine. It's inexpensive and rather good!

Good location, vibrant part of the city.

Cons:

English is sketchy for some of the staff, although one guy there speaks great English so it was not really a problem.

Our mains arrived moments after our starter. It might just be 'that way' in this part of the world, but perhaps ask for your mains to be delayed as we had two courses stacked on top of each other.

Would go again, happily, if only to read the entertaining translations in the English menu;)

The deco was modern with some old stuff here and there. Small but cosy and warm. Very clean.

The waitress knew her wines very well and she spoke good Enough and provided us English menu too, a plus when traveling in Greece as ""everything was Greek to us""!

We quickly ordered couple of dishes. As usual, the servings were rather big for us, including that lovely slab of flat bread topped with sea salt and served with tomato relish and vinaigrette. Oh, the warm bread was so delicious too!

We enjoyed its tuna salad, octopus and sardines. We were not too impressed by its vanilla risotto and paella. Well, those were Italian and Spanish expertise so that's why a Greek restaurant couldn't do as well?

527gretchenl,"July 1, 2019",July 2019,Odos Delfon,Food poisoning and terrible service,"My daughter has been up since 5am with a terrible case of food poisoning after a late night dinner at Odos Delfon.
We had a doctor visit from the local hospital, who confirmed that it is food poisoning, so I’m not just randomly blaming a tummy bug on the restaurant.

We sat down at 10pm on a Sunday night and left after midnight.
The beginning of the meal was good and our waitress was attentive.
The waitress was working as hard as she could, but they were incredibly understaffed for who showed up late on a Sunday. So she was constantly back and forth without a moment to stop.
Several reviews mentioned that the restaurant is popular with families because it is non-smoking. We were surrounded by smoke, and my younger daughter needed to keep going inside to be able to breathe. We all reeked of cigarettes by the end. So, no: this is not a non-smoking restaurant.

The meal:
My daughters and I had amuse bouche size of delicious corn soup, then I had the restaurant’s signature green salad with sun dried tomatoes, bacon, cherry tomatoes, and vinaigrette (LOTS of it). The girls had a yummy fried cheese with tomato jam appetizer, and that was the end of our good food.
I ordered the roast pork with a fennel purée and some sort of sauce, my younger daughter ordered a sirloin steak “medium” with sweet potato purée and a reduced vinegar pan sauce, and my daughter who got sick ordered the *chicken patties with wild rice and yogurt sauce*. Beware.

The portions were so large that we couldn’t possibly have finished them, so I guess that’s a better value.
But, my pork was so smothered in sauce that I couldn’t tell what part of the roast I was eating. It was incredibly tender, but impossible to distinguish between the meat and the fat, so I kept getting mouthfuls of melting fat. The spice rub on the meat was good, but I ate maybe 1/4 of the meat that was there because I couldn’t handle more unidentified mush. The best part of that plate was the vegetable purée.
My younger daughter’s “medium” meat came out rare, enormous, smothered in a sauce that was way too sweet, and we would have asked for it to be cooked more thoroughly, but our waitress did not return to check or come near enough for us to ask. The meat was tender and flavorful, but the sweet reduction sauce drowned out any flavor. And, because it was so underdone, she was only able to eat a few of the outer slices. Again, the sweet potato purée was very yummy.

Now, the item that ruined the night and all of today: the chicken patties that have been positively described in other reviews.
The plate looked pretty, with four small patties resting against wild black rice with yogurt sauce beside it. My daughter took a few bites, said it was good, and then offered us each a bite. Thank goodness we both had a very small bite from the outside of a patty. I thought it tasted undercooked, but my daughter said that it was just the red peppers mixed in and it was fine. I should have looked more closely.
She ate two patties, which were, indeed, undercooked (we know now). She had a few bites of the black wild rice, but said that it tasted “rubbery and strange”.
The sauce was so so.

After 45 minutes of sitting with our mostly full plates on the table, my daughter was finally able to flag the waitress down and ask for dessert menus. The desserts were both good, especially the delicious galaktoboureko with peach sauce and lemon sorbet. Per custom, we were each given an after dinner drink (cherry juice for the girls). Wanting to just get home, we paid cash and left.

We are staying at The Makedonia Palace Hotel, and this is our second trip to Thessaloniki. We’ve eaten all over the area and our dinner last night was by far the worst experience we’ve had. There are plenty of just so-so restaurants around, and lots of fantastic ones, but I am astounded that this one is rated on Trip Advisor as #5 for the entire town. The other highly rated restaurants we’ve visited within a 20 to 30 minute walk from our hotel have all been fabulous.

We are in town for a family wedding, and intended to drive down to Volos to meet up with family today, but are unable to leave because of this food poisoning. She’s spent the entire day since 5 am in the bathroom and lying on her bed, spaced out from the meds. She threw up her dinner. Believe me, we did not need to see it again. Gross. Everything else was digested and fine, not her main course.

Had she not gotten food poisoning, I would not have written a review. I would have chalked it up to a mediocre meal at an understaffed restaurant.
But I do not understand how Odos Delfon is rated as #5 when our experience was not only bad but also potentially very dangerous. Had my other daughter had that meal, she would have had to be hospitalized. Meanwhile, my poor girl is stuck in bed, sick as a dog, and we don’t know when we’ll be able to join our family. Whatever you do, do not visit this place. And definitely do not order the undercooked chicken patties.",1.0

But oh, well. We ordered two glasses of house wine, one white and one rose, both decent and easy drinking. We had the mediterranean salad to start with. Nothing special. Small. The roasted veggies were so few and finely chopped you needed a magnifying lens to find them. It also took a while to arrive which doesn't make sense as it was only a salad, plus we and the couple right next to us were the only ones who ordered food - everyone else was having coffees. We had the grilled chicken breast fillets with roasted veggies and homemade potato mash as a main. It was a very nicely presented and big portion. The roasted veggies and the homemade mash were delicious. The chicken was dry and tasteless with no marinade. The waitress recommended the chocolate lava cake with mango ice cream for dessert but said it would take 15 mins cos it's made to order. It took about half an hour and there was no apology. Plus, it was the most disappointing dessert i've ever tried! We only ate the ice cream, the cake was bad. We were offered free shots of mastic liqueur at the end of our meal. I would not return.",2.0

damien-s-reynolds,"October 27, 2020",October 2020,Pizza Hood,Nice pizza!,"Arrived in Thessaloniki for a family leisure trip and we wanted quick food from a restaurant close to our hotel (The Modernist). It was around a 10-minute walk down a few side streets, which we absolutely wouldn't have found if it were not for GoogleMaps!
The area seemed busy with a few bars and eateries, however, I would say the area was a little rough around the edges. I'm not sure I'd particularly want to go back to the area itself for any other reason other than to grab some food and go ...
The service seemed ok -if a little brusk- but the pizza was very good. The portions are huge (1 large pizza is from memory 10 euros), but I'd say this could easily feed 2 adults (and perhaps even a child). We had Margherita and prosciutto ham pizzas and both were enjoyable, however, whilst it was very good and tasty, I wouldn't say it was the best pizza I'd ever had (and did disappoint slightly, taking into consideration its high Tripadvisor).
The restaurant wasn't particularly comfortable either as it was outdoor benches.

All in all, the food is very nice and I'd recommend a trip if you're in Thessaloniki and fancy pizza in a chilled out informal dining setting ... I'm not sure it'd be the end of the world if you didn't end up going though!",4.0

I was a bit early for dinner so it was pretty calm when i arrived. From the momemt i came inside i was greeted on a very friendly way and got advise on the pizza's that where on the menu. (All sounded great!). As i am traveling alone and it wasn't busy at the time i had a nice talk with Chris ( the guy that serves you there) who is a very cool and friendly guy! As the evening went on one of Chris his friends stopped at the restaurant to have a drink at the windowbar and i ended up having a few drinks and a good time with her while things where getting bussy in the restaurant. So i can say i had a full on great evening at this place and i strongly recomend it! The food is great, the people who work there are great and the peaple who sit there are great! Also the music that they play creates a very nice atmosphere and i can't say anything bad about this restaurant! So just go there i would say!

Keep it up!

We were so impressed that we returned the next night, and even attempted to return a third night but they were fully booked. The food was nothing short of amazing - from the mezes to the main dishes! The staff was kind and very helpful, able to recommend and attentive. At 21:00 every night, there is a live show of great greek music, played at a volume that is just perfect for the enjoyment of the meal!
Especially good was the eggplant and the fava in the mezes, the bread (really!!), the salted mackerel, and in my opinion, the grilled sardines were breathtaking - a simple but perfect dish!
Be sure to RESERVE AHEAD OF TIME for the weekend - we were lucky to find the last table on Friday, and on Saturday we were unable to find a seat due to the legitimate popularity of the place!

Also ordered a wrap from the appetizer section with hot meat. Great with the Greek yogurt! For dessert they gave us little cheesecake cups that was VERY good.

DancingLaughter,"June 24, 2016",June 2016,Rouga,Everything Great except Mosquitos,"We loved the unique decorations in the small walking/patio where Rouga's located. The staff were very informative and friendly. We had this divine cheese fondu with bread that could easily served 4+ people as an appetizer. We actually shared with other diners near us who kept asking the servers what we had ordered. Everyone really like it.

The moussaka was good in your own hot bowl serving. The chicken soulvaki was prepared well. The Euro Cup had just began, so they had a screen up outside for people to watch. Two men played live music closer inside which was nice.

The only negative was after we ordered, many mosquitos came out after dusk and feasted on me where we sat outside of the restaurant. It was really hard to enjoy the food and literally slapped them off of me. It was the first time in my week of being in Greece that I saw or got bitten by them. I don't know if Rouga may have had spray but another guest or two also had the issue once it got dark.

Savvas2013,"April 3, 2022",April 2022,Opsopoion Maganie,just set it right,"Long time before writing a new personal opinion, but I had that feeling I should say something about that place :) .
Frequent customer in its previous location, first time to the new own. Very convenient, easily accessible and with plenty of distance between tables, due to covid restrictions. Nice music in the background, did not check the rest rooms. And now, specifically, about our total experience: very adequate personnel, a menu oriented to meet lovers, a very intriguing wine list with bargain choices. We had an extensive order of cold hors-d'œuvre (codfish specially treated and matured), warm hors-d'œuvres (roasted bone marrow, Greek goat cheese with berries and etc, Greek grilled sausage with kimchi), a fresh green salad and two mains beef, special cuts (bavette and picanha). Lots of wine (2 glasses of rose Ktima Skouras Rose, a bottle of Protopapas 2016, a bottle of Ktima Porto Carras 2011, a bottle of Prosecco DOC extra dry), 2 sweets, 3 espressos, water, water, water, ..., bread, service, etc...Everything served accurate, polite, as ordered. All in all, a very well prepared, served, tasted, priced menu. We paid around 60 euros pp, plus tip. Very very decent price, totally value for money. If you want to go high, of course there are more options (beef 100-250 € / Kg, more expensive wines, ...), this is up to you. Personally, and as a wine lover, I totally appreciate restaurants which are pricing wines logically, and give us the chance to try more, different, options. All of us had an excellent time, will go again.",5.0

ST64,"August 31, 2015",August 2015,Opsopoion Maganie,"Nice place, good service, but something is missing...","The point of this restaurant is unusual, as it is in a narrow small street beside the large beach avenue of Thessaloniki (Nea Paralia), at the beginning of it. It is a small restaurant and their catalogue is small, which means that the food is fresh and cooked at the time of order. In the summer you can sit outside (3-4 tables only). In the beginning came a cheese dip which was tasty. We took the green salad with roasted vegetables (6,5 Euros), which was OK and the portion was good. The fried ""batzos"" cheese (4 Euros) was 3 pieces of it and was nice, the ""fava"" starter (4 Euros) was OK with caramelised onions (I should prefer it cold instead of warm), the village sausage was nothing special but OK, the mushrooms with a sauce of garlic butter (5,5 Euros) were tasty, the burger with the fresh fried potatoes (8,5 Euros) had no dried bread in it, nor spices, so I found it a bit hard and tasteless. We took profiterol and pavlova as desserts (6 Euros each), which were freshly made and very good. The bottled wines start at 13,5 Euros (most of them are at 20 Euros or more). In the end they gave us (free) a generous portion of Cretan schnaps (tsikoudia), which was nice. All these had a cost for 4 persons of 68 Euros, which means that if we took more main dishes (we took only one) we should pay about 100 Euros. The service was friendly. So why the 3 points? Because, while it seems that they try to sell a bit ""searched"" cuisine, I didn 't find something with an extra taste at these dishes; it was the usual one. And this is what is missing.

Jx4travel,"July 8, 2018",July 2018,Loupino,Good value but a bit too salty for us,"Went with the TA's review and chose Loupino for dinner. Ordered Greek salad, Grilled Octopus, cheese croquette, grilled lamb chops, pork souvlaki. It's big portion and it's enough for three people. The service was very good. English speaking staff with no problem communicating. Free dessert (ice cream on chocolate biscuit ) on the house at the end, which is a nice touch. The salad was nice and fresh, but my friend found it a bit too salty.( I thought it was Ok). Then the cheese croquette was nice, again, found it a bit too salty. The grilled octopus was the worst... it was so salty that it tasted bitter... also, it's stated that it's frozen octopus on the menu. At first, I thought it shouldn't matter, but it wasn't as ""bouncy"" as the fresh ones. So it does matter. The prom souvlaki and lamb chops went the complete opposite of being salty, they tasted like no salt... but the flavour were still good. All in all, I would still recommend you to try it. If you are as sensitive as me in regards of salt, then ask them not to put any salt when cooking. There is salt at the table anyway.",4.0
